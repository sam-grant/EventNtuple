## Validation

We want to make sure that any changes we make to the code don't:
* stop fcl files from working, or
* change the content of the EventNtuple unexpectedly

### Validating EventNtuple Runs
From ```EventNtuple/``` directory:

```
. ./validation/test_fcls.sh
```

This script will run all the supported fcl files over relevant datasets. All tests should report ```OK```

### Creating a Validation File
Before making any changes, create an EventNtuple file and run the validation script. This creates a new ROOT file with histograms created from the EventNtuple ntuple:

```
mu2e -c EventNtuple/fcl/from_mcs_mockdata.fcl -S filelist.txt --TFileName nts.ntuple.before.root

root -l -b EventNtuple/validation/create_val_file_rooutil.C\(\"nts.ntuple.before.root\",\"val.ntuple.before.root\"\)
```

### Validating EventNtuple Contents
To make sure that the contents of the EventNtuple haven't changed, we use [valCompare](https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Validation#valCompare) to compare the histograms generated by the ```create_val_file.C``` script:

```
valCompare -p ntuple-validation-booklet.pdf -r val.ntuple.before.root val.ntuple.after.root
```

Note that the ```before``` file is created before any changes, and the ```after``` file is created by ```test_fcls.sh```.

We expect perfect matches between all histograms. However, in some rare instances, we may expect differences. If you see any non-perfect matches, then discuss with the EventNtuple L4.
