## Event Branches

These branches contain one element per event.

| branch | structure | explanation | leaf information |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| evtinfo |  Single objects branch |   event-level information| [see EventInfo.hh](../inc/EventInfo.hh)
| evtinfomc |  Single objects branch |   MC-truth event-level information| [see EventInfoMC.hh](../inc/EventInfoMC.hh)
| hitcount |  Single objects branch |   counts of different hit types in an event| [see HitCount.hh](../inc/HitCount.hh)
| tcnt |  Single objects branch |   counts track types and track-related quantities in an event (MARKED FOR REMOVAL)| [see TrkCount.hh](../inc/TrkCount.hh)
## Track Branches

Each element in these branch corresponds to a different Kalman fit hypotheses to reconstruct the track:

In most cases, there are 4 different Kalman fit hypotheses:
- downstream electron

- downstream positron

- downstream negative muon

- downstream positive muon


In case the track is reflected (it has an upstream leg and a downstream leg), then each event contains 8 elements, the last 4 being upstream equivalent of the 4 listed above.

If a Kalman fit fails or there are multiple downstream tracks to fit, the number of element may vary.

## Track segments Branches

These branches contain 4 elements per event corresponding to different Kalman fit hypotheses (see Track branches).

Within each Kalman fit element, there is a vector describing the track segment parameters when intersecting virtual detectors (identified by their surface id sid).

## Straw Branches

These branches contain a vector in which each element lists the properties of a straw hits in the tracker.

The number of elements in the vector is found in the leaf trk.nhits.

## Monte Carlo Branches

These branches contain 4 elements per event corresponding to different Kalman fit hypotheses (see Track branches).

Within each Kalman fit element, there is a vector containing Monte Carlo truth information about the particle making the track and its parent particles.

The vector is sorted in reverse chronological order, such that the last element is the initial particle simulated in GEANT4, and each element before correspond to one of its daughter particles.

## CRV Branches

These branches contain a vector where each element is a CRV hit that happened during the event.
The branch is empty if there are no CRV hit during the event.
